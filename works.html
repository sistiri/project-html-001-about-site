                    <h2>FIRST JOB</h2>
                    <p>Cheap. Easy. Instant. If building your own website seems too good to be true, that’s because it
                        is.
                        There are hundreds of website builders out there, and it can be tempting to view creating your
                        own site as a quick-fix solution to getting your business online, but the reality of a
                        self-build website is often far from ideal.

                    <h2>SECOND JOB</h2>
                    <p>Whilst many templated website builders may advertise free or low-cost services,
                        the fact is that this rarely holds true, not to mention that the time involved
                        in personally building and maintaining your site all comes at an indirect cost to
                        your business.

                    <h2>THIRD JOB</h2>
                    <p>Creating an effective website is hard work - at the very least it involves design and SEO
                        know-how – and for this reason self-builds are incredibly inefficient. Instead 
                        of exerting all your energy building a website, your time is much better spent 
                        doing what you do best – running your business.
